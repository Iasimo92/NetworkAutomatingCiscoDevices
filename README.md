> Simple Scripts to automate configuration in Cisco Devices
> The testing environment built in GNS3 2.2.28 Using Cisco IOS Software, 7200 Software (C7200-ADVENTERPRISEK9-M), Version 15.3(3)XB12 Image for Router and Cisco IOS Software, Linux Software (I86BI_LINUXL2-ADVIPSERVICESK9-M), Version 15.2 for switch emulation. The aim for this simple project is to explore Network Devices and Network Automation via building scripts that interact with network devices.
